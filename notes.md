looks like all we need to do is order the web service - lol
7:15 PM

i just sent an email to the web service people to see if the email address works and to see if they would be the appropriate people to ask questions to.



Brets terms that I don't understand from the NASDAQ doc:

1)  UTP Level 1
2)  CTA
3)  FINRA
4)  So this document explains that the input value would be the ticker name such as AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and the possible outputs are such things as bestAskPrice, close, and high?  Is the process that we are supposed to implement already created and we just put it in place, or do we need to add some code to the database java script, such as what we found at:

or

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/428073/what-is-the-best-simplest-way-to-read-in-an-xml-file-in-java-application


?
